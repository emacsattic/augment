      <p>Augment is a system for gathering metadata from code and
	displaying it. This metadata will include test
	failures, test coverage levels, complexity metrics, and
	others. The display frontends are pluggable so as to interface
	with many editors and environments.</p>

      <p>You can <tt>gem install augment</tt> to play around with it.</p>

      <h3>Usage</h3>

      <p>Ideally you would rarely use augment directly, but rather you
      would interact with it from within whatever environment
      you use as an editor. How you use augment is highly dependent on
      what editor you're using to interact with it. Augment currently
      supports these editors:</p>

      <ul>
	<li><a href='emacs.html'>GNU Emacs</a></li>
	<li><a href='textmate.html'>Textmate</a> (limited support)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As you can see, that's a short list. If you'd like to
      implement augment support for your editor, it's pretty easy. See
      the <a href='writing_frontends.html'>writing a frontend guide</a> for
      details.</p>

      <p>Augment works by running a set of <a href='backends.html'>backends</a>
      on a file to gather metadata about it and passing off that
      metadata to frontends that get feedback to the user.</p>

      <h3>Inspiration</h3>

      <p>Augment came out of
      a <a href='http://technomancy.us/static/feedback_slides.tar.gz'>talk
      from Rubyconf 2007</a>.</p>
