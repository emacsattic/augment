<p>Augment frontends are ways in which data collected by
  the <a href='backends'>backends</a> is fed back to the user. In the
  interests of keeping the feedback loop as tight as possible, it's
  desirable that these frontends operate within editing environments
  so that they are most visible. The following editing environments
  are currently supported:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href='emacs.html'>GNU Emacs</a></li>
  <li><a href='textmate.html'>Textmate</a> (limited support)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use augment independently, but it's likely to be much less
  convenient. If you're interested in doing this, augment has two
  non-editor frontends: the ANSI shell color codes frontend and the
  HTML frontend. They are mostly used for testing purposes.</p>

<p>To use the ANSI color frontend, type <tt>augment ansi FILENAME</tt>
  in a compliant terminal to see what metadata augment has stored
  about that file.</p>

<p>To use the HTML frontend, type <tt>augment html FILENAME >
    file.html</tt> and the file will contain what you're looking
    for.</p>

<p>Adding support for new editors is not difficult if you know the
  internals of your editor well (as you should.) See
  the <a href='writing_frontends.html'>writing frontends guide</a> for
  details.</p>
