<p>Currently Textmate support is very limited because Textmate does
  not expose sufficient hooks into its rendering system. You can still
  get at your augment data, it's just not as seamless as it could
  be.</p>

<p>TODO: Andr&eacute; can explain how it works...</p>

<p>Support is expected to improve in Textmate 2.0 as the extension API becomes mature.</p>
