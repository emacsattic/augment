<p>Augment frontends are intentionally kept very simple in order to
  avoid duplicated effort. In order to implement them, you have to do
  at least three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Parse the layer files from JSON for the current file.</li>
  <li>Render the layers in the files they apply to. This should be
    implemented as just changing the background color of a range of
    characters.</li>
  <li>Allow the user to see the message associated with the layer in
    which the cursor currently resides.</li>
  <li><i>Bonus</i>: send the file name to <tt>augment
      --interactive</tt> when a file is saved and parse the response.</li>
  <li><i>Bonus</i>: allow the user to specify which backends they want
    to use, preferrably on a per-file basis.</li>
</ol>

<p>That last step will become more important as more backends are implemented.</p>

<p>TODO: explain more stuff!</p>
