<p>The Emacs frontend to augment currently implements a very small set
  of commands. To activate this functionality, install it by copying
  the <tt>lib/frontends/augment.el</tt> file into your Emacs load path
  and adding <tt>(require 'augment)</tt> to your <tt>.emacs</tt>
  file. (Note that augment relies on <tt>json.el</tt> being
  installed. If you don't have this, you can get it from
  <a href='http://edward.oconnor.cx/2006/03/json.el'>Edward
  O'Connor</a>.) Once you've done this you'll be able to
  invoke <tt>M-x augment-mode</tt>.</p>

<p>In augment-mode, saving a file will result in selected backends
  being run on it and the results of those backends being displayed in
  the buffer. Currently only the test/unit backend will run. You also
  have access to the following key bindings:</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>C-c C-s</tt> - augment-initiate (kick off the augment
    process for selected backends</li>
  <li><tt>C-c C-i</tt> - augment-show-message (show the message
    associated with the layer at point</li>
  <li><tt>C-c C-k</tt> - augment-clear (remove layers)</li>
</ul>

<p>Tests for <tt>augment.el</tt> may be found
  in <tt>spec/emacs-frontend-test.el</tt>. These
  require <a href='http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ElUnit'>elunit</a> to run.</p>
